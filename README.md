# js103-planets

Break now for a class exercise. Have students create a new directory named modules where they will create an HTML and a JS file. The JS file should create an IIFE module named SolarSystem. Have the student create properties and methods for the following:

Getter for an array of planets that cannot be modified.

Getter/setter for number of planets that humans have landed people or robots on.

Public property for holding a last modified date.

Getter/setter for spacecraft currently exploring solar system. These should be stored in a private array.

Any other fun/related data that the student wants to add.
